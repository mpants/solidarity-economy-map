				<h2>Finding Local Food With the Soleco Map</h2>
				<p>As an example of how to use the map, let's look up locally grown food!</p>
				<p><strong>1. Select what you're looking for - for example, "Food."</strong></p><p><img src="/map/images/tutorial-1.jpg" width="645"/></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><strong>2. Select what value or practice you want the map to highlight. Here, we want to see places that have locally-grown food.</strong></p>
				<p><img src="/map/images/tutorial-2.jpg" width="645"/></p>
				<p><strong>3. The map now shows places that provide <em>Food</em> and practices <em>Local Sourcing of Food</em>. You can select one from the List on the left, or the Icons on the map to find out where and what a place is, as well as what other positive economic practices it participates in.</strong>
				<p><img src="/map/images/tutorial-3.jpg" width="645"/></p>
				<p><strong>Those are the basics! Remember that the map is growing all the time, and is only as good as the listings everyone contributes to it. If you want to make a more useful map, please help us to <a href="/map/addplace.html">Add a Place</a>.</strong></p>

 				<!--
				Where we live. Who we meet. What we think about. Every aspect of our lives is influenced by the economic system we have inherited.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				
					The wealth we believe in is not the wealth of global corporations, abstract financial trades, or an unlimited growth economy.
					<br>
					It is not factory farms or warehouses full of workers treated like machines, only to soon be replaced by them.
					<br>
					The wealth we believe in is that of the dignity, the experience, and the collaboration of our community.
					<br>
					It is the promise that the act of meeting our needs is something all of us can participate in without exploitation.
					<br>
					Instead of setting us to compete against eachother, it restores the relationships that enable true life.ba
					<br>
					Finally, it is one that leaves a healthy soil, air, water, city, and opportunity to those who will follow.
