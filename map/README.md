Google Maps / JS implementation for local economic network mapping

Following the model of SolidarityNYC and the global Solidarity Economy movement.  Affiliated with the New Economics and Transition movements.  This map is a growing record of the businesses, nonprofits, and public places that provide ways to meet our needs without big corporations. More than a "buy local" movement, it identifies the practices existing in your community that are planting the seeds of a more sustainable people-and-planet economy.
