				<h1>Questions Someone Might Conceivably Ask At Some Point</h1>
<h3>Where do Solidarity Economies come from?</h3>
<p>There is nothing new about what we are doing. The diverse origins of the Solidarity Economy range from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen">Robert Owen</a>’s 18<sup>th</sup> century experiments with workers’ cooperatives, to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landless_Workers%27_Movement">Landless Workers’ Movements</a> of the Global South, to French theories of Economie Sociale, to the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation">Mondragon</a> federation of worker cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, to the unemployed workers’ movements in <a href="http://www.geo.coop/node/149">Argentina</a> and, more recently, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chicago-JwJ-Unemployed-Workers-Council/124863750868279">Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The image below was created by Ethan Miller to help us visualize all the sectors of the economy that need to be democratized, from creation of raw materials to production of goods, exchange and transfer, consumption, and allocation of surplus. Click the image to enlarge it. If you&#8217;d like to read more about this, see Ethan&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="The Movement" href="http://s187935660.onlinehome.us/soleco/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Solidarity-Economy_Circle-and-Key.pdf">Elements of a Solidarity Economy</a>&#8221; (PDF).</p>

Some organizations that are working on these issues now in the U.S. are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ussen.org/">U.S. Solidarity Economy Network</a></li>
<li><a href="http://neweconomyworkinggroup.org/">New Economy Working Group</a></li>
<li><a href="http://solidaritynyc.org/">Solidarity NYC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.haverford.edu/politicalscience/solidarityeconomy/index.php">Solidarity Economy Resources</a> (on Haverford College website)</li>
<li><a href="http://aloe.socioeco.org/index_en.html">Alliance for a Responsible, Plural, and Solidarity Economy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.solecopedia.org/index.php/Main_Page">Solecopedia</a>, the shared international encyclopedia for solidarity and social economy</li>
</ul>
				<h3>Why a map?</h3><p>One of our major sources of inspiration was <a href="http://solidaritynyc.org">SolidarityNYC</a>. We were influenced by their choice to start with a mapping project. A good map can serve two functions right away: it can be an immediately useful, usable tool that lets people retrieve information, and it can help give an identity to something invisible. It also was a needed step for us to understand what already exists around us. Part of the joy of this project is the constant discovery of places already existing in our neighborhoods and towns.</p><p>There are now around a dozen known Solidarity Economy Maps in the US, and internationally we're most excited by Brazil's for its massive 22,000 organization Economia Solidária.<p>We're also excited by the possibilities around printing a map for places in the community to feature.</p><p>If you want to map your own region, our <a href="https://github.com/nostickgnostic/solidarity-economy-map">code</a> and <a href="mailto:info@solidaritypiedmont.org">support</a> is yours; you should also check out this thorough <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/how-to-map-the-new-economy">mapping tutorial</a> from Shareable.net!</p>
<h3>Who made this?</h3><p>All this is the work of Solidarity Piedmont - a group which formed when Occupy Chapel Hill's Solidarity Economy working group met with other activists from the Durham area and became friends. For months, we met regularly in Carrboro, and then moved things over to Durham. Recently, we've taken a break from meeting as some of our members have become more involved in other activist projects, including Transition Durham, NCWarn, and the Piedmont Learning Commons.</p><p>Some of the brave altruists who regularly donated hours of their time to this project include Amanda, Candace, Don, Francesca, Gordon, Jacob, <a href="http://mpants.cc">Matt</a>, & Sally. Space was also donated by the ever-evolving <a href="https://github.com/nostickgnostic/solidarity-economy-map">Recyclique</a>.</p>
<h3>Wait, what is a Solidarity Economy again?</h3><p>In one sense, a Solidarity Economy can be thought of as a way of relating economically that identifies shared values and makes those values central to how it develops and interconnects. Not purely capitalist, socialist, or any-ist, it is a shared step forward that expresses itself through a variety of structures, formal and informal, public and private, old and new.</p><p>What are the values behind a Solidarity Economy?  Brazil cites seven that we find it easy to agree with:<br><ol><li>Self-management</li><li>Democratization of economic relations</li><li>Co-operation instead of forced competition</li><li>Valuing diversity. Human beings are more important than profits</li><li>Valuing local knowledge, constant learning and training</li><li>Social justice and emancipation</li><li>Protection of the environment</li></ol>
</p><p>Solidarity Economies tend to also express themselves through certain structures - community land trusts, alternative currencies, CSAs, credit unions, social investment funds, participatory budgeting, fair trade, an increase or revitalization of the commons - and many new ones yet emerging to meet the needs of our rapidly-changing world.</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>The biggest thing of all is to <a href="addplace.html">add to the map</a>! We are too few now to collect good data or to know everything that belongs on here. Please add submissions to the map and we'll review them as soon as we can.</p><p>It's also really important to use the map and share it with others who are new to the region or would like to learn about how to participate in a more humane economy.</p><p>You may notice the map has a lot more density in some towns than others, even though it is designed for the whole Piedmont region. You would make our day by volunteering to add places in Greensboro, Burlington, Raleigh, or any other town considered part of the Piedmont region!</p>
<h3>How can we talk?</h3>
<p><a href="mailto:info@solidaritypiedmont.org">E-mail</a> is good and in-person is best (but that'd take e-mail, first). We're also on twitter, but would like to post the huge caveat that it is now a publicly traded corporation whose revenue comes from advertising. Twitter is not local, it does not serve the public good (as a publicly traded corporation, it is legally obligated not to), and it has injected itself into our lives as a "necessary" tool that profits off of our everyday interactions and even our engagement with causes. If you already have a twitter, please "follow" us on there <a href="http://twitter.com/solpied">@Solpied</a>, but do so mindfully. If you don't have a twitter account yet, I'd suggest waiting for <a href="trsst.com">Trsst</a>, an in-development open-source non-corporate alternative.</p>

				Where we live. Who we meet. What we think about. Every aspect of our lives is influenced by the economic system we have inherited.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				
					The wealth we believe in is not the wealth of global corporations, abstract financial trades, or an unlimited growth economy.
					<br>
					It is not factory farms or warehouses full of workers treated like machines, only to soon be replaced by them.
					<br>
					The wealth we believe in is that of the dignity, the experience, and the collaboration of our community.
					<br>
					It is the promise that the act of meeting our needs is something all of us can participate in without exploitation.
					<br>
					Instead of setting us to compete against eachother, it restores the relationships that enable true life.ba
					<br>
					Finally, it is one that leaves a healthy soil, air, water, city, and opportunity to those who will follow.
