				<h1>Reinvent the Economy, Place by Place.</h1>
				<p>
				We can meet the needs of our communities without exploitation, injustice, and ever-widening inequality. With our daily choices, we can cultivate a world where corporations do not dictate our lives and laws, poverty is not a path to prison, and no one is left waiting for the trickle-down.</p>
                <p>The <a href="/map/solecomap.html">Solidarity Economy Map</a> is a growing resource for highlighting and connecting the local businesses and organizations that are a part of creating an economy that values human dignity, diversity, fairness, and sustainability, above profits for the few.</p>
                <p>More than a "buy local" or ethical purchasing movement, the Solidarity Economy is an incremental shift away from business as usual. It is a gradual, careful, collaborative answer to the failings of capitalism and state socialism both. It works through small, spreadable changes, and thrives through a diversity of approaches and structures.</p>
				<p>Practices it promotes include <strong>living wages</strong>, <strong>cooperative ownership</strong>, <strong>workplace democracy</strong>, <strong>sustainability & re-use</strong>, <strong>local sourcing</strong>, and more.</p>
                <p>This Solidarity Economy Map originated in Carrboro, NC, so that's what you'll see the most of on here - but the goal is to include Durham, Greensboro, Raleigh, surrounding areas, and then eventually, the entire Piedmont region. We also offer the source code online and free technical support so that other communities, nationally or internationally, can create their own Solidarity Economy Map.</p>

 				<!--
				Where we live. Who we meet. What we think about. Every aspect of our lives is influenced by the economic system we have inherited.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				
					The wealth we believe in is not the wealth of global corporations, abstract financial trades, or an unlimited growth economy.
					<br>
					It is not factory farms or warehouses full of workers treated like machines, only to soon be replaced by them.
					<br>
					The wealth we believe in is that of the dignity, the experience, and the collaboration of our community.
					<br>
					It is the promise that the act of meeting our needs is something all of us can participate in without exploitation.
					<br>
					Instead of setting us to compete against eachother, it restores the relationships that enable true life.ba
					<br>
					Finally, it is one that leaves a healthy soil, air, water, city, and opportunity to those who will follow.
