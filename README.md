======================

*Google Maps / Bootstrap / JS implementation for local economic network mapping*

The Solidarity Economy Map is a growing resource for highlighting and connecting the local businesses and organizations that are a part of creating an economy that values human dignity, diversity, fairness, and sustainability, above profits for the few.

More than a "buy local" or ethical purchasing movement, the Solidarity Economy is an incremental shift away from business as usual. It is a gradual, careful, collaborative answer to the failings of capitalism and state socialism both. It works through small, spreadable changes, and thrives through a diversity of approaches and structures.

Practices it promotes include living wages, cooperative ownership, workplace democracy, sustainability & re-use, local sourcing, and more.

This Solidarity Economy Map originated in Carrboro, NC, so that's what you'll see the most of on here - but the goal is to include Durham, Greensboro, Raleigh, surrounding areas, and then eventually, the entire Piedmont region. We also offer the source code online and free technical support so that other communities, nationally or internationally, can create their own Solidarity Economy Map.


## Technology and Development

The Solidarity Economy Map:

* Currently pulls data from a Google Fusion Table, populated by occasional CSV imports

* Relies on Google Maps. It would be awesome to move to Open Street Maps someday...

* Could use a lot of code clean up and documentation

* Is not yet mobile-friendly and will take a different approach for mobile not based on a map

* Was designed with no budget and no official organizational support

## Starting a Local Map

The goal of the mapping project has always been to create a tool that would be usable for other communities.  I can offer limited support in setting one up for your area.  What you would need would be to have a champion who has intermediate HTML, CSS, and JS skills to customize it for your region.

## Motivations

Love motivates everything meaningful that we ever do.
